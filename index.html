      <h2>Department of MECHATRONICS ENGINEERING:</h2>
      <p>Mechatronics Engineering incorpate technological skills needed to meet the requirement of inter-connected industries.
        The areas covered under mechatronics enginnering includes the different elements of mechatronics systems such as the principle of core mechanical engineering, signal conditioning, sensors, actuators, microcontrollers and programmable logic controllers. And many things to learn......Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field of science that incorporates a blend of mechanical, electronics, electrical and computer engineering. Initially, Mechatronics was confined to mechanics and electronics; subsequently the field does not only restrict to the latter but also has broadened its horizons to include broader technical fields that involves designing, testing and operation of machinery and equipment. Mechatronics comprises high level functional integration of mechanical systems with electronics and computer control. Mechatronics intends to enhance the functionality of specialized frameworks and the formation of new equipmentâ€™s and machinery with intelligence. The Department of Mechatronics was established in the year 2011 for Post Graduate Courses. Later in the year 2014, Undergraduate program with an intake of 60 was started. The department has state of the art infrastructure and laboratories. Presently the Department has over 180 students. Department offers Under Graduate as well as Post Graduate courses in Mechatronics. The Laboratories are perfect balance of Mechanical, Electronics as well as Computer Science with Hydraulics and Pneumatics Lab, Mechanical Measurements and Metrology Labs, Material Testing Lab, Microcontroller Lab, Analog and Digital Electronics, Electric Machine Drives, Advanced Computer Programming Lab and so. Recently, the Department has set up the Micro and Smart System Lab and is establishing an advanced Robotics Lab.</p>
